        "summary": "Fix the Admin Settings page (`frontend/src/pages/AdminSettingsPage.tsx`) so that when the current user does not have admin access AND the admin role is vacant (i.e., `getAdminPrincipal` returns an empty/null principal or `claimAdminIfVacant` would succeed), the page displays a 'Claim Admin' button that calls `useClaimAdminIfVacant`. Currently the page only shows 'You do not have admin access' without offering the claim option. The logic should be: (1) if the user IS the admin — show the full admin panel (reassign, vacate); (2) if the user is NOT the admin but the admin role IS vacant — show the 'Claim Admin (if vacant)' button with explanatory text; (3) if the user is NOT the admin and an admin IS already assigned — show the 'You do not have admin access' message only. Show success or error feedback after the claim attempt.",
