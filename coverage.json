        "summary": "Fix the Profile Setup Modal in `frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx` so that clicking 'Get Started' after entering a name does not freeze or get stuck. Investigate and resolve the issue causing the modal to hang on submission — likely the `createUserProfile` (or equivalent) mutation call is not resolving or the loading state is never cleared. Ensure: (1) the 'Get Started' button shows a loading spinner while the mutation is in-flight; (2) on success the modal closes and the user proceeds normally; (3) on error a visible error message is displayed and the button becomes re-clickable; (4) the button is disabled only while the mutation is actively pending, never indefinitely.",
