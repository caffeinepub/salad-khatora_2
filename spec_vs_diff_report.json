  "summary": "The diff implements all four acceptance criteria for REQ-1. CustomersPage.tsx now uses useActor to check actor readiness, disables the submit button while the actor is initializing, shows inline alert messages when the actor is unavailable or when mutations fail, and relies on React Query cache invalidation to update the customer list without a page reload. useQueries.ts is also updated to throw descriptive errors when the actor is unavailable. No immutable files were modified. No unrequested features were added.",
